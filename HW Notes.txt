Notes for Pymoli HW

1.) 85/15 Male to Female Split; very lopside gender demographics.
	a.) However, If you look at the Avg Purchase Price and Average Total Purchase price per person,
	Women account for on average, buy 21.9% more then men. This is something that if possible, a way to market
	to women should be exploited.

2.) 70 percent of Players are aged 24 and younger; this means you have a huge Adult market untapped.
	a.) Distribution of Avg Total Purchase also confirms this; your 35-39yr old demographic represented your
	highest spending per person at $4.76/per.

3.) Final Critic is by far your most popular game; however, #3 Nirvana has a higher purchase price.
	This is something a good marketing campaign could exploit to boost profits.


Notes for PyCity Schools HW

1.) 	Charter Schools = Performance at a Lower Cost per Student; Your Charter Schools accounted for your Top 5 performing Schools.
	a.) Wilson and Cabera High Schools also accounted for your lowest Per Student Budgets 
	at $578 and $582 per student.
	b.) Your Worst Performing Schools were District Schools; all of which had Per Student Budgets between $637 and $655 per Student

3.)	Spending more per Student does not equal in higher grades. Quite the contrary, the best overall scores were at $615 per student and lower.
	a.) A magnitude size difference (15% and greater loss in Overall Grades) was achieved when spending exceeded $615 per student.

2.) 	Student Body Size makes a difference in grades.
	a.) The top 5 performing schools had a Student Body average of 1641 students (median of 1635).
	Your 5 worst performing schools had  a Student Body average of 3743 students (median of 2949). 
	This is also proved out in your scores by School Size; Large Schools (2000-5000) had the lowest scores on Avg
	b.) An assumption that could be drawn is that due to larger populations requiring larger class sizes
	(or more teachers if class size was held constant) has resulted in lower test scores as standards
	have not been able to be maintained.

3.) 	Scores stay relatively the same across Grades; Whether its for reading or math, when looking at scores by grade,
	the school roughly had their students average the same from 9th through 12th.
